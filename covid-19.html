            <p class="text-black lead mb-4">We understand everyone’s concerns and we will maintain cleanliness and follow all guidelines that have been put in place by the CDC and Federal/State/Local Governments.  We have completed our required business affirmation for re-opening, and we have our NY Forward Safety Plan in place.  Our employees are familiar with the CDC Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting and some of the products we have on hand include, but are not limited to, Decon 30 and Pure Green 24 (both are EPA registered disinfectants), Barbicide, bleach, isopropyl alcohol, disposable gloves and face masks.<br><br>

            We respect all of you and hope you show the same respect as we navigate through our re-opening.  If you do not agree with anything outlined below, please consider waiting to visit our facility until some of the restrictions are lifted and you are more comfortable.  Please read this carefully so you understand what to expect when visiting.  We appreciate your full understanding and cooperation, and remember, we are all in this together.  Now more than ever, respiratory wellness is essential, and it is the number one reason people are visiting salt therapy providers.  We are committed to providing you with a safe place to simply relax, unplug, breathe easy and work on self-care.  Thank you.<br><br>

            All staff members will be asked a series of questions regarding COVID-19 symptoms and have their temperature checked before every shift.  We will be cleaning and disinfecting our desk area and all sharable objects on a regular basis and hand sanitizer will be readily available.  All staff members are required to wear a face cover and we have gloves readily available.<br><br>

            We have replaced several floor rugs and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected all areas in our facility.  We have also removed paper pamphlets and business cards from the counter and placed them behind the desk.  We will happily provide them as requested.  This is to help create a low-touch environment.<br><br>

            Restrooms and other high touch surfaces throughout our facility will be cleaned and disinfected several times throughout the day.<br><br>

            Hand sanitizer and tissues will be available throughout our facility and you are encouraged to use them.<br><br>

            Everyone will be required to CALL to schedule an appointment.  Our “book online” feature is temporarily disabled, and an appointment will be required.  NO walk-ins will be accepted at this time so we can better control the number of people in our facility at once.<br><br>
            
            A face cover (cloth covering or mask) is REQUIRED to enter our facility.  We have the right to deny entry if someone arrives without a face cover.  Please NO exceptions.  This is for everyone’s safety.  If you do not want to wear a face cover, please do not visit our facility until that restriction is lifted. <br><br>

            We are going to continue to book sessions (halotherapy, hand/foot detox, saunas) at the top of every hour and we ask you to arrive 10 minutes early for check-in process.  If you are late, you will be asked to come back at a different time.  Please NO EXCEPTIONS.  We cannot start late because we need the time in between sessions to clean and disinfect.  <br><br>

            As part of the check-in process, you will be required to complete a short COVID-19 waiver.  The form will ask if you have any COVID-19 symptoms such as: running a fever, chills, body aches, recent cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or new loss of taste or smell.  If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, we will ask you to contact your health care provider and come back at a different time.  If you have a fever, please stay home.<br><br>

            Blankets will NOT be offered in the salt cave or halo room, but you are welcome to bring your own clean blanket.  As always, you are welcome to bring a light jacket or sweater to put on if you tend to get chilly.<br><br>

            We will not be scheduling any halotherapy family hours (children) for the time being.  However, if you have children that need a halotherapy session, please let us know and we will work with you.  We will not be providing any toys at this time and you cannot bring any from home.  Children will not be allowed to play in the salt so they will need to sit on your lap or in a chair during the session.  Please feel free to bring a book if you’d like.  Again, we are  creating a low-touch environment.<br><br>

            Waiting Area – we have blocked off some of the chairs to allow for physical distancing.  Everyone will be required to have a face cover on while in the waiting room and other areas of our facility.<br><br>

            Lockers – we will allow people to use the lockers; however, we ask that you sanitize your hands before using them and again after using them.  Sanitizer will be provided.  We will also sanitize keys/doors on a regular basis.<br><br>

            Salt Cave – 6 people per session to adhere to 6’ physical distancing: maximum group of 8 if together (generally 10 per session).  Halo Room – 4 people per session to adhere to 6’ physical distancing: maximum group of 6 if together (generally 7 per session).  NO blankets will be offered at this time.  Shoe covers are mandatory (as always), and a staff member will pass them out.  You are encouraged to grab a tissue before entering your session in case you need to cough.  Once seated, you may remove your face cover to enjoy your session.  After your session, please put your face cover back on before getting up from your chair.  Place your foot covers and used tissues in the trash outside of the room.<br><br>

            Hand/Foot Detox Room – 3 people per session to adhere to 6’ physical distancing: maximum group of 6 if together (generally 6 per session).  We have temporarily pulled all pillows and blocked off 3 chairs.  The additional chairs will be easily accessible for a bigger group if together.  Drinks will be allowed (water, tea).  As always, we will clean and disinfect between sessions.<br><br>

            Saunas – 1 person per session; maximum of 2 people if together.  We will continue to offer towels, wet wipes, and a bottle of water during your session.  We ask for you to place ALL soft goods in the towel basket and wet wipes and water bottles in the trash can so our staff can dispose/recycle them properly.  As always, we will rotate soft goods and clean and disinfect between sessions and ionize inside the sauna.<br><br>

            Oxygen Bar – all sharable objects have been removed to create a low-touch environment.  We will provide a small kraft paper bag for you to place your used nose hose in after your session and a covered trash can will be available for disposal.  Drinks will be allowed (water, tea).  The area will be cleaned and disinfected between sessions. <br><br> 

            In summary, our staff will be wearing a face cover, washing our hands often, using sanitizer and will stay home if we are not feeling well.  As always, we will be cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces on a regular basis.
